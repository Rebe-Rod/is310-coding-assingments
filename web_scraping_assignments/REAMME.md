The fandom that I chose was from Over the Garden Wall (would recommend if you haven't seen it already!). You can find the link here: https://over-the-garden-wall.fandom.com/wiki/Over_the_Garden_Wall_(comics_series). 

The robots.txt link can also be found here: https://over-the-garden-wall.fandom.com/robots.txt. This link states that certain forms of web scraping are allowed. 

I chose to scrape this website because I believe that it is important for people to be able to see where this incredile show originaled from in a more simplified format. The file explains the issues of the original comics and a small summary about them. 

You will need to have pandas, beautiful soup, requests, os, console, and json to run this!
