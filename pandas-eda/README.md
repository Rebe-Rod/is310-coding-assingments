Hello! This project focuses on the the data analysis of a dataset about books and their ratings. I explore the dataset and see what interesting facts and trends are found. I also create some data visulizations to get a better understanding of the data. The goal is to get a better grasp at finding these trends and how data visualization can be used to find and support your findings. 

Some libraries you will need include: 
-pandas
-altair

Enjoy!
