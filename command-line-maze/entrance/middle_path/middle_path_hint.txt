You feel a chill down your spine as you continue forward. Clutching your jacket, you see that the path splits off into two.

From the left path, you see something orange in the distance.
From the right path, you see something yellow just out of reach. 

The pull you felt once before is not as strong at it used to be, but you feel a strange sense of deja vu when looking at the orange items.
