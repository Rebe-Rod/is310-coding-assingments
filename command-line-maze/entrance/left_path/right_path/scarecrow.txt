You find an old scarecrow that appears to have been there for some time. It is filled with dirt and the overgrown vines have completely covered the stick it's propped on and parts of its legs. 

"Hello! It has been too long since I have seen someone else. Thank you for finding me. I hope you remember where you came from because I'd like to get out of here!"
